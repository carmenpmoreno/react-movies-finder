# Introduction 

Movie finder with a favorites page to store your favorite movies. It includes a user menu and an option to store your opinion about the movies from the favorites page. A responsive website and a React and Redux project.

It includes a mock login system that stores the username in sessionStorage. To log in, enter the user "general user".

As a database I use the REST API http://www.omdbapi.com.
To store favorite movies I use the browser's localStorage.
